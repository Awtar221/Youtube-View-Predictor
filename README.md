# ðŸ“ˆ Youtube View Predictor

Predict YouTube video views using data science and machine learning!

## Overview

This project leverages Jupyter Notebooks and Python data science libraries to analyze YouTube video data and build models that predict the number of views a video will receive. It's designed as a practical example of applying data science skills to real-world social media analytics.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing for YouTube datasets
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization
- Feature engineering to improve model performance
- Building and evaluating regression models to predict video views
- Insights into factors affecting YouTube video popularity

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** (100%)
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Awtar221/Youtube-View-Predictor.git
   cd Youtube-View-Predictor
   ```

2. **Open the notebook(s):**
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Open the `.ipynb` files to explore the code, data, and results.

3. **Experiment:**
   - Follow along with the code cells.
   - Try tweaking features or model parameters.
   - Visualize new insights or test your own hypotheses!

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Main Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and modeling
- `data/`: (If available) Sample datasets or links to public data sources
- `README.md`: This file

## Results

The notebook(s) include:
- Visualizations of trends and correlations in YouTube data
- Feature importance analysis
- Model evaluation metrics (RÂ², RMSE, etc.)
- Example predictions vs. actual view counts
